# Employment Form

## About
This form is a secure PHP form made at a previous co-op. This form is considered a template form since it contains distinctive features 
that can be used or discarded for any purpose. The form undergoes both form validation and input validation and displays intuitive messages to the user. The form also protects against SQL Injection and Cross Site Scripting attacks through data sanitization/escaping, prepared statements, and a secure hashing algorithm. The form uses PHP sessions and cookies to improve the user experience, such that data is saved across different pages and submit requests. Employee data is stored in MySQL. The form is delivered through a responsive and cross-platform user interface using HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap. Each component of the form is stored in a seperate file which is then required in the index.php file. This allows any component of the form to be easily modifiable, which is the purpose for a template form.
