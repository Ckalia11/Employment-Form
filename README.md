# Form Template

## About
This repository contains a secure PHP form template that can be used for various purposes. The form includes several distinct features and provides robust validation mechanisms for both form and input data. Users are presented with intuitive messages for better usability.

To ensure security, the form has implemented measures against SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting attacks. These include data sanitization/escaping, prepared statements, and a secure hashing algorithm.

Form data is securely stored in a MySQL database. Additonally, the form is delivered through a responsive and cross-platform user interface, leveraging HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap. Each component of the form and its respective validation logic is stored in separate file, which are then required in the index.php file. This modular structure allows for easy modification of any form component.
